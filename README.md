# Business-Deck-Website
A repository for the customizable Agency website

## Initial Start-up
You will first need to install the node modules into the correct directories (api & clent). 
This assumes you already have node set-up. If you don't have it installed, follow the directions for your machine. 
You will also need to have MongoDB installed. Once you have both of those, you are ready to complete the set-up of the project by installing the modules in the project using the following commands:
## Terminal 1:
#### cd api
#### npm install

## Terminal 2:
#### cd client
#### npm install

## Running the File
You will need three terminals for the front-end (client), backend (api), and mongoDB database

## Terminal 1:
#### mongosh

## Terminal 3:
#### cd client
#### npm start

## Terminal 2:
#### cd api
#### npm start

## Terminal 3:
#### cd client
#### npm install
